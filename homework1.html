        <p> My name is Michelle!</p>
        <p>My major is Child Study and Human Development.</p> 
        <p>My IP address is 130.64.35.18.</p> 
        <p>I grew up in Lawrence, MA.</p>
        <p>Something no one would expect from me is that I've dislocated both of my knees 
            and popped them back myself!</p>
        <p>My favorite place is the beach!</p>
